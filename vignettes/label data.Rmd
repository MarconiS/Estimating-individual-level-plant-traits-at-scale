## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r reticulate}
#test kld dimensionalyt reduction
setwd("..")
outdir_kld = "~/Documents/Data/Chapter3/plots/kld/"
#get_kld_reduction(path_hsi, bands = 7, outdir = outdir)
list_rasters <- list.files( "~/Documents/Data/Chapter3/plots/hsi/", recursive = F, full.names = T, pattern = ".tif")
pblapply(list_rasters, get_preset_kdl, outdir=outdir_kld)

```

```{r reticulate}
#test kld dimensionalyt reduction
outdir = "~/Documents/Data/Chapter3/plots/decor/"
setwd("..")
#get_kld_reduction(path_hsi, bands = 7, outdir = outdir)
list_rasters <- list.files( "~/Documents/Data/Chapter3/plots/mage/", recursive = F, full.names = T, pattern = ".tif")
pblapply(list_rasters, decorrelation_stretch, outdir)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
