toolbox to extract ecological information at individual tree level from NEON data

This repo contains all the code to extract individual tree crown information at scale using NEON lidar and hiperspectral imaging presented in the paper "Estimating individual level plant traits at scale" published in Ecological Applications. All code and results are open to be reused under MIT licence: feel free to contact me for further information on how to use it. Please submit an issue if anything is not working on your machine, more documentation is needed, or any other suggestion.
